# A Creative Technologist's Guide to GitHub & AI-Powered Workflows

Welcome! This tutorial is designed to guide you, a creative technologist, through the essentials of [GitHub](https://github.com), modern development tools like [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and the exciting world of AI-assisted workflows.

The journey involves some initial setup, which can feel a bit intensive, but the rewards are substantial: a powerful, largely free toolkit that can revolutionise how you manage projects, collaborate, and even create.

## What You'll Learn

This guide will walk you through:

1.  **Understanding Git & GitHub:** What are they, and why are they indispensable for modern creative work? ([See Chapter 1](./01_why_git.md))
2.  **Essential Setup:** Getting your accounts and tools in place, including GitHub, Git, VS Code, and a free AI API key. ([See Chapter 2](./02_setup_overview.md))
3.  **Core Git Workflow:** The fundamental commands and practices for version controlling your projects. ([See Chapter 3](./03_core_workflow.md))
4.  **Collaboration & Recovery:** Working with others and leveraging Git's power to experiment safely and recover from mistakes. ([See Chapter 4](./04_collaboration_recovery.md))
5.  **GitHub Pages:** Hosting your own free portfolio or project websites directly from your repositories. ([See Chapter 5](./05_github_pages.md))
6.  **AI-Powered Workflows:** Using tools like Roo Code within VS Code to accelerate your development, documentation, and creative processes. ([See Chapter 6](./06_ai_workflows_roo_code.md))
*   Understanding context windows, token costs, and best practices for AI interaction ([See Chapter 6.5](./06_ai_workflows_roo_code.md#65-context-windows-cost--tool-comparison))
7.  **Advanced Typesetting:** Setting up LaTeX with WSL2, TeXLive, and VS Code for professional document creation. ([See Chapter 8](./08_latex_wsl_vscode.md))
8.  **Context Management & Advanced Workflows:** Mastering AI interactions. ([See Chapter 9](./09_context_management.md))

## Philosophy

This workshop and guide are built on the idea of "vibe coding" – an iterative, exploratory approach to creation, supercharged by AI. While the tools are powerful, the process is about learning, experimenting, and not being afraid to ask the AI (or your collaborators) for help.

Let's begin this journey to unlock new potentials in your creative practice!
