## Philosophy

The development of tools like OpenAI Codex signifies a shift towards more "agentic" coding, where AI functions less like a simple autocompleter and more like a virtual teammate. This guide encourages embracing AI as a co-developer, capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks autonomously with guided instruction. The aim is to empower developers to delegate effectively, allowing them to focus on higher-level architectural decisions and creative problem-solving.

As one of the experts in the workshop put it:
> "this is an agent that is good at like independent software engineering work and like the more we lent into that the more like things started to feel really special."

And another highlighted the importance of mindset:
> "you must have an abundance mindset and you must think of it as like not using your time to explore things... the way we see people who like love codeex the most using it is they don't they think for like maybe 30 seconds max about their prompt... you just send it off."
